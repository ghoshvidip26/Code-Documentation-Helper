Launch an EC2 instance using the launch
            instance wizard in the console

Launch an EC2 instance using the launch
            instance wizard in the console
You can launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the launch instance wizard in the Amazon EC2 console.
        The wizard provides default values for the launch parameters, which you can either accept or
        modify to suit your requirements. The only parameter that is not specified is the key pair.
        If you choose to accept the default values, you can quickly launch an instance by selecting
        only a key pair.
Important
You incur charges for the instance while the instance is in the
running
state, even if it remains idle.
However, if you qualify for the
                Free Tier, you might not incur charges. For more information, see
Track your Free Tier usage for Amazon EC2
.
For a description of each parameter in the launch instance wizard, see
Reference for Amazon EC2 instance configuration parameters
.

Quickly launch an instance
To set up an instance quickly for testing purposes, follow these steps. You'll select
            the operating system and your key pair, and accept the default values. Except for the
            key pair, the launch instance wizard provides default values for all of the parameters.
            You can accept any or all of the defaults, or configure an instance by specifying your
            own values for each parameter.

To quickly launch an instance using the launch instance wizard
Open the Amazon EC2 console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
.
In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, the current AWS Region is
                    displayed (for example, US East (Ohio)). If needed, select a
                    different Region in which to launch the instance.
From the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, choose
Launch instance
.
(Optional) Under
Name and tags
, for
Name
, enter a descriptive name for your
                    instance.
Under
Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)
,
                    choose
Quick Start
, and then choose the operating system
                    (OS) for your instance.
Under
Key pair (login)
, for
Key pair
                        name
, choose an existing key pair or create a new one.
In the
Summary
panel, choose

.
Launch an instance using
                defined parameters
If you're launching an instance that you'll use in production, you'll need to
            configure the instance to suit your requirements. For a description of each parameter in
            the launch instance wizard, see
Reference for Amazon EC2 instance configuration parameters
.
To launch an instance by defining all the launch parameters using the launch
                instance wizard
Open the Amazon EC2 console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
.
In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, the current AWS Region is
                    displayed (for example, US East (Ohio)). If needed, select a
                    different Region in which to launch the instance.
From the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, choose
Launch
                    instance
.
(Optional) Under
Name and tags
, for
Name
, enter a descriptive name for your instance so
                    that you can easily keep track of it.
The instance name is a tag, where the key is
Name
, and
                    the value is the name that you specify.
Under
Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)
,
                    choose the operating system (OS) for your instance, and then choose an
                    AMI.
An AMI is a template that contains the operating system and software required
                    to launch your instance.
Under
Instance type
, choose an instance type.
The instance type determines the hardware configuration (CPU, memory, storage,
                    and networking capacity) and size of the host computer used for your
                    instance.
If you're not sure which instance type to choose, you can do the
                    following:
Choose
Compare instance types
to compare
                            different instance types by the following attributes: number of vCPUs,
                            architecture, amount of memory (GiB), amount of storage (GB), storage
                            type, and network performance.
Choose
Get advice
to get guidance and suggestions
                            for instance types from the EC2 instance type finder. For more information, see
Get recommendations from EC2 instance type finder
.
Note
Depending on when you created your account, you might be able to use
                        instance types for free under the Free Tier. These instance types are
                        labeled
Free tier eligible
.
If your created your AWS account before July 15, 2025 and it's less than
                        12 months old, you can use Amazon EC2 under the Free Tier by selecting the
t2.micro
instance type, or the
t3.micro
instance type in Regions where
t2.micro
is unavailable. Be aware that when you
                        launch a
t3.micro
instance, it defaults to
Unlimited mode
, which might incur
                        additional charges based on CPU usage.
If you created your AWS account on or after July 15, 2025, you can use
t3.micro
,
t3.small
,
t4g.micro
,
t4g.small
,
c7i-flex.large
, and
m7i-flex.large
instance types for 6 months or until
                        your credits are used up.
For more information, see
Free Tier benefits before and after July
                    15, 2025
.
Under
Key pair (login)
, for
Key pair
                        name
, choose an existing key pair or create a new one. If you do
                    not require a key pair to connect to your instance, you can choose
Proceed without a key pair (not recommended)
.
Under
Network settings
, you can keep the defaults if
                    you're launching a test instance. If you're launching a production instance,
                    it's best practice to control traffic into and out of your instance using
                    network settings and security groups that you define.
Under
Configure storage
, you can keep the defaults or
                    specify additional storage. The AMI you selected includes one or more volumes of
                    storage, including the root volume. You can specify additional volumes to attach
                    to the instance.
You can use the
Simple
or
Advanced
view. With the
Simple
view, you specify the size and type
                    of the volume. To specify all volume parameters, choose the
Advanced
view (at top right of the card).
For
Advanced details
, expand the section to view the
                    fields and specify any additional parameters for your instance.
In the
Summary
panel, you can do the following:
Specify the number of instances to launch.
Review your instance configuration, and navigate directly to a section
                            by choosing its link.
When you're ready to launch your instance, choose
Launch
                                instance
.
If the instance fails to launch or the state immediately goes to
terminated
instead of
running
, see
Troubleshoot Amazon EC2 instance launch issues
.
(Optional) You can create a billing alert for the instance. On the
                    confirmation screen, under
Next Steps
, choose
Create billing alerts
and follow the directions.
                    Billing alerts can also be created after you launch the instance. For more
                    information, see
Creating a billing alarm to monitor your estimated AWS charges

                    the
