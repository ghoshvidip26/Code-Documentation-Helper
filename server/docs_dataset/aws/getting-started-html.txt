Create your first Lambda function

Create your first Lambda function
To get started with Lambda, use the Lambda console to create a function. In a few minutes, you can create and deploy a
    function and test it in the console.
As you carry out the tutorial, you'll learn some fundamental Lambda concepts, like how to pass arguments to 
    your function using the Lambda
event object
. You'll also learn how to return log outputs from your function, and how to 
    view your function's invocation logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
To keep things simple, you create your function using either the Python or Node.js runtime. With these interpreted languages, you can edit 
    function code directly in the console's built-in code editor. With compiled languages like Java and C#, you must create a deployment package on 
  your local build machine and upload it to Lambda. To learn about deploying functions to Lambda using other runtimes, see the links in the
Additional resources and next steps
section.

Prerequisites
If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.
To sign up for an AWS account
Open
https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup
.
Follow the online instructions.
Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call or text message and entering 
  a verification code on the phone keypad.
When you sign up for an AWS account, an
AWS account root user
is created. The root user has access to all AWS services
  and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform
tasks that require root user access
.
AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign-up process is
complete. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by
going to
https://aws.amazon.com/
and choosing
My
  Account
.
After you sign up for an AWS account, secure your AWS account root user, enable AWS IAM Identity Center, and create an administrative user so that you 
don't use the root user for everyday tasks.
Secure your AWS account root user
Sign in to the
AWS Management Console
as the account owner by choosing
Root user
and entering your AWS account email address. On the next page, enter your password.
For help signing in by using root user, see
Signing in as the root user
in the
AWS Sign-In User Guide
.
Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your root user.
For instructions, see
Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user (console)
in the
IAM User Guide
.
Create a user with administrative access
Enable IAM Identity Center.
For instructions, see
Enabling
 AWS IAM Identity Center
in the
AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide
.
In IAM Identity Center, grant administrative access to a user.
For a tutorial about using the IAM Identity Center directory as your identity source, see
Configure user access with the default IAM Identity Center directory
in the
AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide
.
Sign in as the user with administrative access
To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user.
For help signing in using an IAM Identity Center user, see
Signing in to the AWS access portal
in the
AWS Sign-In User Guide
.
Assign access to additional users
In IAM Identity Center, create a permission set that follows the best practice of applying least-privilege permissions.
For instructions, see
Create a permission set
in the
AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide
.
Assign users to a group, and then assign single sign-on access to the group.
For instructions, see
Add groups
in the
AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide
.
Create a Lambda function with the console
In this example, your function takes a JSON object containing two integer values labeled
"length"
and
"width"
. 
      The function multiplies these values to calculate an area and returns this as a JSON string.
Your function also prints the calculated area, along with the name of its CloudWatch log group. Later in the tutorial, youâll learn to use
CloudWatch Logs
to view records of your functionsâ invocation.
To create a Hello world Lambda function with the console
Open the
Functions page
of the Lambda console.
Choose
Create function
.
Select
Author from scratch
.
In the
Basic information
pane, for
Function name
, enter
myLambdaFunction
.
For
Runtime
, choose either
Node.js 24
or
Python 3.14
.
Leave
architecture
set to
x86_64
, and then choose
Create function
.
In addition to a simple function that returns the message
Hello from Lambda!
, Lambda also creates an
execution role
for your function. An execution role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants a Lambda function 
      permission to access AWS services and resources. For your function, the role that Lambda creates grants basic permissions to write to CloudWatch Logs.
Use the console's built-in code editor to replace the Hello world code that Lambda created with your own function code.
Node.js
To modify the code in the console
Choose the
Code
tab.
In the console's built-in code editor, you should see the function code that Lambda 
              created. If you don't see the
index.mjs
tab in the code editor, select
index.mjs
in the 
              file explorer as shown on the following diagram.
Paste the following code into the
index.mjs
tab, replacing the code that Lambda created.
export const handler = async (event, context) =>
{
const length = event.length;
  const width = event.width;
  let area = calculateArea(length, width);
  console.log(`The area is $
{
area}`);
        
  console.log('CloudWatch log group: ', context.logGroupName);
  
  let data =
{
"area": area,
  };
    return JSON.stringify(data);
    
  function calculateArea(length, width)
{
return length * width;
  }
};
In the
DEPLOY
section, choose
Deploy
to update your function's code:
Understanding your function code
Before you move to the next step, let's take a moment to look at the function code and understand some key Lambda concepts.
The Lambda handler:
Your Lambda function contains a Node.js function named
handler
. A Lambda function in Node.js can contain more 
                  than one Node.js function, but the
handler
function is always the entry point to your code. When your function is 
                  invoked, Lambda runs this method.
When you created your Hello world function using the console, Lambda automatically set the name of the handler method for your 
                  function to
handler
. Be sure not to edit the name of this Node.js function. If you do, Lambda wonât be able to run your code 
                  when you invoke your function.
To learn more about the Lambda handler in Node.js, see
Define Lambda function handler in Node.js
.
The Lambda event object:
The function
handler
takes two arguments,
event
and
context
. An
event
in Lambda is a JSON formatted document that contains data for your function to process.
If your function is invoked by another AWS service, the event object contains information about the event that caused the invocation. For example, if your function is invoked when an object is uploaded to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, the event contains the name of the bucket and the object key.
In this example, youâll create an event in the console by entering a JSON formatted document with two key-value pairs.
The Lambda context object:
The second argument that your function takes is
context
. Lambda passes the
context object
to your 
                  function automatically. The context object contains information about the function invocation and execution environment.
You can use the context object to output information about your function's invocation for monitoring purposes. In this example, 
                  your function uses the
logGroupName
parameter to output the name of its CloudWatch log group.
To learn more about the Lambda context object in Node.js, see
Using the Lambda context object to retrieve Node.js function information
.
Logging in Lambda:
With Node.js, you can use console methods like
console.log
and
console.error
to send information to your 
                  function's log. The example code uses
console.log
statements to output the calculated area and the name of the 
                  function's CloudWatch Logs group. You can also use any logging library that writes to
stdout
or
stderr
.
To learn more, see
Log and monitor Node.js Lambda functions
. To learn about logging in other runtimes, see the 'Building with' pages 
                    for the runtimes you're interested in.
Python
To modify the code in the console
Choose the
Code
tab.
In the console's built-in code editor, you should see the function code that Lambda 
                created. If you don't see the
lambda_function.py
tab in the code editor, select
lambda_function.py
in the file explorer as shown on the following diagram.
Paste the following code into the
lambda_function.py
tab, replacing the code that Lambda created.
import json
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    
    # Get the length and width parameters from the event object. The 
    # runtime converts the event object to a Python dictionary
    length = event['length']
    width = event['width']
    
    area = calculate_area(length, width)
    print(f"The area is
{
area}")
        
    logger.info(f"CloudWatch logs group:
{
context.log_group_name}")
    
    # return the calculated area as a JSON string
    data =
{
"area": area}
    return json.dumps(data)
    
def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length*width

.
Logging in Lambda:
With Python, you can use either a
print
statement or a Python logging library to send information to your function's 
                log. To illustrate the difference in what's captured, the example code uses both methods. In a production application, we recommend 
                that you use a logging library.

Log and monitor Python Lambda functions
. To learn about logging in other runtimes, see the 
              'Building with' pages for the runtimes you're interested in.
Invoke the Lambda function using the console code editor
To invoke your function using the Lambda console code editor, create a test event to send to your function. The event is a JSON formatted 
          document containing two key-value pairs with the keys
"length"
and
"width"
.
To create the test event
In the
TEST EVENTS
section of the console code editor, choose
Create test event
.
For
Event Name
, enter
myTestEvent
.
In the
Event JSON
section, replace the default JSON with the following:
{
"length": 6,
  "width": 7
}
Choose
Save
.
To test your function and view invocation records
In the
TEST EVENTS
section of the console code editor, choose the run icon next to your test event:
When your function finishes running, the response and function logs are displayed in the
OUTPUT
tab. You should see results similar to the following:
