Uploading objects

Uploading objects
When you upload a file to Amazon S3, it is stored as an S3
object
. Objects consist of the file data and metadata that describes the object.
    You can have an unlimited number of objects in a bucket. Before you can upload files to an Amazon S3
    bucket, you need write permissions for the bucket. For more information about access
    permissions, see
Identity and Access Management for Amazon S3
.
You can upload any file typeâimages, backups, data, movies, and so onâinto an
    S3 bucket. The maximum size of a file that you can upload by using the Amazon S3 console is 160 GB.
    To upload a file larger than 160 GB, use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or Amazon S3 REST
    API.
If you upload an object with a key name that already exists in a versioning-enabled bucket,
    Amazon S3 creates another version of the object instead of replacing the existing object. For more
    information about enabling versioning, see
Enabling versioning on buckets
.
Depending on the size of the data that you're uploading, Amazon S3 offers the following options:
Upload an object in a single operation by using the AWS SDKs,
          REST API, or AWS CLI
â With a single
PUT
operation, you can
        upload a single object up to 5 GB in size.
Upload a single object by using the Amazon S3 console
â
With the Amazon S3 console, you can upload a single object up
        to 160 GB in size.
Upload an object in parts by using the AWS SDKs, REST API, or
          AWS CLI
â
Using the multipart upload API
        operation, you can upload a single large object, up to 50 TB in size.
The multipart upload API operation is designed to improve the upload experience for
        larger objects. You can upload an object in parts. These object parts can be uploaded
        independently, in any order, and in parallel. You can use a multipart upload for objects
        from 5 MB to 50 TB in size. For more information, see
Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3
.
To upload files greater than 5 TB, use the S3 Transfer Manager in the Java v1/v2, Python, or
    AWS CLI SDKs. For the best performance, use the latest AWS Common Runtime (CRT) with these SDKs,
    which has been optimized for better resource utilization.
When uploading large objects from memory stream, CRT buffers each part up to 5 GB in memory,
    limiting overall throughput by allocated memory. You can adjust the CRT memory limit using
    configuration options such as
maxNativeMemoryLimitInBytes
for Java SDK. For uploads
    from disk, CRT automatically switches to direct disk streaming instead of intermediate part
    buffering, improving memory usage. This behavior is automatically enabled for large objects, but
    can also be enabled for smaller files via request parameters such as
should_stream
for AWS CLI and
CRT_MEMORY_BUFFER_DISABLED
for Java SDK.
When you upload an object, the object is automatically encrypted using server-side
    encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. When you download it, the object is
    decrypted. For more information, see
Setting default server-side encryption behavior for Amazon S3
      buckets
and
Protecting data with encryption
.
When you're uploading an object, if you want to use a different type of default encryption,
    you can also specify server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) in your S3
PUT
requests or set the default encryption configuration in the destination
    bucket to use SSE-KMS to encrypt your data. For more information about SSE-KMS, see
Specifying server-side encryption with AWS KMS
      (SSE-KMS)
. If you want
    to use a KMS key that is owned by a different account, you must have permission to use the
    key. For more information about cross-account permissions for KMS keys, see
Creating KMS keys that other accounts can use
in the
AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide
.
If you encounter an Access Denied (403 Forbidden) error in Amazon S3, see
Troubleshoot access denied (403
                Forbidden) errors in Amazon S3
to learn more
    about its common causes.
Upload an object
This procedure explains how to upload objects and folders to an Amazon S3 bucket by using the
    console.
When you upload an object, the object key name is the file name and any optional
      prefixes. In the Amazon S3 console, you can create folders to organize your objects. In Amazon S3,
      folders are represented as prefixes that appear in the object key name. If you upload an
      individual object to a folder in the Amazon S3 console, the folder name is included in the object
      key name.
For example, if you upload an object named
sample1.jpg
to a folder named
backup
, the key name is
backup/sample1.jpg
. However, the object
      is displayed in the console as
sample1.jpg
in the
backup
folder.
      
      For more information about key names, see
Working with object metadata
.
Note
If you rename an object or change any of the properties in the Amazon S3 console, for example
Storage Class
,
Encryption
, or
Metadata
, a new object is created
      to replace the old one. If S3 Versioning is enabled, a new version of the object is created,
      and the existing object becomes an older version. The role that changes the property also
      becomes the owner of the new object (or object version).
When you upload a folder, Amazon S3 uploads all of the files and subfolders from the specified
    folder to your bucket. It then assigns an object key name that is a combination of the uploaded
    file name and the folder name. For example, if you upload a folder named
/images
that contains two files,
sample1.jpg
and
sample2.jpg
, Amazon S3 uploads the files and then assigns the corresponding
    key names,
images/sample1.jpg
and
images/sample2.jpg
.
    The key names include the folder name as a prefix. The Amazon S3 console displays only the part of
    the key name that follows the last
/
. For example, within an
images
folder, the
images/sample1.jpg
and
images/sample2.jpg
objects are displayed as
sample1.jpg
and a
sample2.jpg
.
To upload folders and files to an S3 bucket
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
.
In the left navigation pane, choose
Buckets
.
In the
Buckets
list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to
        upload your folders or files to.
Choose
Upload
.
In the
Upload
window, do one of the following:
Drag and drop files and folders to the
Upload
window.
Choose
Add file
or
Add folder
, choose the
            files or folders to upload, and choose
Open
.
To enable versioning, under
Destination
, choose
Enable
          Bucket Versioning
.
To upload the listed files and folders without configuring additional upload options, at
        the bottom of the page, choose
Upload
.
Amazon S3 uploads your objects and folders. When the upload is finished, you see a success
        message on the
Upload: status
page.
To configure additional object properties
To change access control list permissions, choose
Permissions
.
Under
Access control list (ACL)
, edit the permissions.
For information about object access permissions, see
Using the S3 console to set ACL
					permissions for an object
. You can grant
        read access to your objects to the public (everyone in the world) for all of the files that
        you're uploading. However, we recommend not changing the default setting for public read
        access. Granting public read access is applicable to a small subset of use cases, such as
        when buckets are used for websites. You can always change the object permissions after you
        upload the object.
To configure other additional properties, choose
Properties
.
Under
Storage class
, choose the storage class for the files that
        you're uploading.
For more information about storage classes, see
Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes
.
To update the encryption settings for your objects, under
Server-side encryption
          settings
, do the following.
Choose
Specify an encryption key
.
Under
Encryption settings
, choose
Use
              bucket settings for default encryption
or
Override
                bucket settings for default encryption
.
If you chose
Override bucket settings for default encryption
,
            you must configure the following encryption settings.
To encrypt the uploaded files by using keys that are managed by Amazon S3, choose
Amazon S3
                  managed key (SSE-S3)
.
For more information, see
Using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys
			(SSE-S3)
.
To encrypt the uploaded files by using keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), choose
AWS Key Management Service key (SSE-KMS)
. Then choose one of the following
                options for
AWS KMS key
:
To choose from a list of available KMS keys, choose
Choose from your
                      AWS KMS keys
, and then choose your
KMS key
from
                      the list of available keys.
Both the AWS managed key (
aws/s3
) and your customer managed keys appear in this
                      list. For more information about customer managed keys, see
Customer keys and AWS
                        keys
in the
AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide
.
To enter the KMS key ARN, choose
Enter AWS KMS key ARN
,
                      and then enter your KMS key ARN in the field that appears.
To create a new customer managed key in the AWS KMS console, choose
Create a 
                      KMS key
.
For more information about creating an AWS KMS key, see
Creating
                      keys
in the
AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide
.
Important
You can use only KMS keys that are available in the same AWS Region as
                  the bucket. The Amazon S3 console lists only the first 100 KMS keys in the same
                  Region as the bucket. To use a KMS key that is not listed, you must enter
                  your KMS key ARN. If you want to use a KMS key that is owned by a different
                  account, you must first have permission to use the key and then you must enter the
                  KMS key ARN.
Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys, and not asymmetric KMS keys. For
                    more information, see
Identifying symmetric and
                      asymmetric KMS keys
in the
AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide
.
To use additional checksums, choose
On
. Then for
Checksum function
, choose the function that you would like to use.
        Amazon S3 calculates and stores the checksum value after it receives the entire object. You can
        use the
Precalculated value
box to supply a precalculated value. If you
        do, Amazon S3 compares the value that you provided to the value that it calculates. If the two
        values do not match, Amazon S3 generates an error.
Additional checksums enable you to specify the checksum algorithm that you would
        like to use to verify your data. For more information about additional checksums, see
Checking object integrity in Amazon S3
.
To add tags to all of the objects that you are uploading, choose
Add
          tag
. Enter a tag name in the
Key
field. Enter a value for
        the tag.
Object tagging gives you a way to categorize storage. Each tag is a key-value pair. Key
        and tag values are case sensitive. You can have up to 10 tags per object. A tag key can be
        up to 128 Unicode characters in length, and tag values can be up to 255 Unicode characters
        in length. For more information about object tags, see
Categorizing your objects using tags
.
To add metadata, choose
Add metadata
.
Under
Type
, choose
System defined
or
User defined
.
For system-defined metadata, you can select common HTTP headers, such as
Content-Type
and
Content-Disposition
. For a
            list of system-defined metadata and information about whether you can add the value, see
System-defined object metadata
. Any metadata starting with
            the prefix
x-amz-meta-
is treated as user-defined metadata. User-defined
            metadata is stored with the object and is returned when you download the object. Both
            the keys and their values must conform to US-ASCII standards. User-defined metadata can
            be as large as 2 KB. For more information about system-defined and user-defined
            metadata, see
Working with object metadata
.
For
Key
, choose a key.
Type a value for the key.
To upload your objects, choose
Upload
.
Amazon S3 uploads your object. When the upload completes, you can see a success message on the
Upload: status
page.
Choose
Exit
.
You can send a
PUT
request to upload an object of up to 5 GB in a single
          operation. For more information, see the
PutObject
example
          in the
AWS CLI Command Reference
.
You can send REST requests to upload an object. You can send a
PUT
request to upload data in a single operation. For more information, see
PUT Object
.
For examples of how to upload an object with the AWS SDKs, see
Code
            Examples
in the
Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference
.
For general information about using different AWS SDKs, see
Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS SDKs
in the
Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference
.
Prevent uploading objects with identical key names
You can check for the existence of an object in your bucket before creating it using a
      conditional write on upload operations. This can prevent overwrites of existing data. Conditional writes
      will validate there is no existing object with the same key name already in your
      bucket while uploading.
You can use conditional writes for
PutObject
or
CompleteMultipartUpload
requests.
For more information about conditional requests see,
Add preconditions to S3 operations with conditional requests
