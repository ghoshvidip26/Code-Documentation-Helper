Getting started with DynamoDB

Getting started with DynamoDB
Youâll learn how to connect to, create, and manage DynamoDB tables in the following
        sections.
Before you begin, you should familiarize yourself with the basic concepts in Amazon DynamoDB.
        You can get a quick overview in
What is Amazon DynamoDB?
and a more in-depth look in
Core components of Amazon DynamoDB
. Then, continue on to
Prerequisites
.
Note
When you sign up for AWS, you can get started with DynamoDB using the
AWS Free Tier
. If you have not already
            exceeded the free tier benefits for Amazon DynamoDB, it won't cost you anything to complete
            the examples in this section. Otherwise, you'll incur the standard DynamoDB usage fees from
            the time that you create the tables until you delete the tables.
If you don't want to sign up for a free tier account, you can set up
DynamoDB local (downloadable version)
on your computer.
            The downloadable version lets you develop and test applications locally without signing
            up for an AWS account or accessing the DynamoDB web service.
