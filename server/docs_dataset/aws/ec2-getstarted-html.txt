Get started with Amazon EC2

Get started with Amazon EC2
Use this tutorial to get started with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). You'll learn how to launch
		and connect to an EC2 instance. An
instance
is a virtual server
		in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EC2, you can set up and configure the operating system and
		applications that run on your instance.
Overview
The following diagram shows the key components that you'll use in this tutorial:
An image
â A template that contains the software to run on your 
			    instance, such as the operating system.
A key pair
â A set of security credentials that you use to prove your
		        identity when connecting to your instance. The public key is on your instance
		        and the private key is on your computer.
A network
â A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your
				AWS account. To help you get started quickly, your account comes with a default
				VPC in each AWS Region, and each default VPC has a default subnet in each
				Availability Zone.
A security group
â Acts as a virtual firewall to control inbound and
			    outbound traffic.
An EBS volume
â We require a root volume for the image. You can optionally add data
				volumes.
Cost for this tutorial
When you create your AWS account, you can get started with Amazon EC2 for free using the
AWS Free Tier
.
If you created your AWS account before July 15, 2025, it's less than 12
		months old, and you haven't already exceeded the Free Tier benefits for Amazon EC2, it won't
		cost you anything to complete this tutorial, because we help you select options that are
		within the Free Tier benefits. Otherwise, you'll incur the standard Amazon EC2 usage fees from
		the time that you launch the instance (even if it remains idle) until you terminate it.
If you created your AWS account on or after July 15, 2025, it's less than 6 months old,
		and you haven't used up all your credits, it won't cost you anything to complete this
		tutorial, because we help you select options that are within the Free Tier benefits.
For information on how to determine whether you are eligible for the
		Free Tier, see
Track your Free Tier usage for Amazon EC2
.

Next steps
Step 1: Launch an instance
You can launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console as described in the following
			procedure. This tutorial is intended to help you quickly launch your first instance,
			so it doesn't cover all possible options.
To launch an instance
Open the Amazon EC2 console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
.
In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, we display the current AWS Region â
				    for example,
Ohio
. You can use the selected Region, or
					optionally select a Region that is closer to you.
From the EC2 console dashboard, in the
Launch instance
pane, 
					choose
Launch instance
.
Under
Name and tags
, for
Name
, enter
					a descriptive name for your instance.
Under
Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)
, 
					do the following:
Choose
Quick Start
, and then choose the
							operating system (OS) for your instance.  For your first Linux 
							instance, we recommend that you choose Amazon Linux.
From
Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
, select an AMI
that is marked
Free Tier eligible
.
Under
Instance type
, for
Instance type
, select
					an instance type
that is marked
Free Tier
							eligible
.
Under
Key pair (login)
, for
Key pair name
,
					choose an existing key pair or choose
Create new key pair
to
				    create your first key pair.
Warning
If you choose
Proceed without a key pair (Not recommended)
,
						you won't be able to connect to your instance using the methods described in
						this tutorial.
Under
Network settings
, notice that we selected your default VPC,
					selected the option to use the default subnet in an Availability Zone that we
					choose for you, and configured a security group with a rule that allows
					connections to your instance from anywhere (
0.0.0.0.0/0
).
Warning
If you specify
0.0.0.0/0
, you are enabling traffic from any IP addresses in
						the world. For the SSH and RDP protocols, you might consider this acceptable
						for a short time in a test environment, but it's unsafe for production
						environments. In production, be sure to authorize access only from the
						appropriate individual IP address or range of addresses.
For your first instance, we recommend that you use the default settings.
					Otherwise, you can update your network settings as follows:
(Optional) To use a specific default subnet, choose
Edit
and then choose a subnet.
(Optional) To use a different VPC, choose
Edit
and then
							choose an existing VPC. If the VPC isn't configured for public internet
						    access, you won't be able to connect to your instance.
(Optional) To restrict inbound connection traffic to a specific network,
						    choose
Custom
instead of
Anywhere
,
						    and enter the CIDR block for your network.
(Optional) To use a different security group, choose
Select existing 
							security group
and choose an existing security group. If the security
						    group does not have a rule that allows connection traffic from your network,
						    you won't be able to connect to your instance. For a Linux instance, you must
						    allow SSH traffic. For a Windows instance, you must allow RDP traffic.
Under
Configure storage
, notice that we configured a root volume
					but no data volumes. This is sufficient for test purposes.
Review a summary of your instance configuration in the
Summary
panel,
					and when you're ready, choose
Launch instance
.
If the launch is successful, choose the ID of the instance from the
Success
notification to open the
Instances
page and monitor the status of the launch.
Select the checkbox for the instance. The initial instance state is
pending
. 
					After the instance starts, its state changes to
running
. Choose the
Status and alarms
tab. After your instance passes its status 
				    checks, it is ready to receive connection requests.
Step 2: Connect to your instance
The procedure that you use depends on the operating system of the instance. If you can't connect 
			to your instance, see
Troubleshoot issues connecting to your Amazon EC2 Linux instance
for assistance.
You can connect to your Linux instance using any SSH client. If you are running
					Windows on your computer, open a terminal and run the
ssh
command to
				    verify that you have an SSH client installed. If the command is not found,
install OpenSSH for Windows
.
To connect to your instance using SSH
Open the Amazon EC2 console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
.
In the navigation pane, choose
Instances
.
Select the instance and then choose
Connect
.
On the
Connect to instance
page, choose the
SSH client
tab.
(Optional) If you created a key pair when you launched the instance and downloaded
							the private key (.pem file) to a computer running Linux or macOS, run the example
chmod
command to set the permissions for your private key.
Copy the example SSH command. The following is an example, where
key-pair-name
.pem is the name of your
							private key file,
ec2-user
is the username
							associated with the image, and the string after the @ symbol is the
							public DNS name of the instance.
ssh -i
key-pair-name
.pem
ec2-user
@
ec2-198-51-100-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
In a terminal window on your computer, run the
ssh
command 
							that you saved in the previous step. If the private key file is not in the
						    current directory, you must specify the fully-qualified path to the key file in
						    this command.
The following is an example response:
The authenticity of host 'ec2-198-51-100-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com (198-51-100-1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is l4UB/neBad9tvkgJf1QZWxheQmR59WgrgzEimCG6kZY.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
(Optional) Verify that the fingerprint in the security alert matches the
							instance fingerprint contained in the console output when you first start an
							instance. To get the console output, choose
Actions
,
Monitor and troubleshoot
,
Get system log
.
							If the fingerprints don't match, someone might be attempting a man-in-the-middle 
							attack. If they match, continue to the next step.
Enter
yes
.
The following is an example response:
Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-198-51-100-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
To connect to a Windows instance using RDP, you must retrieve the initial administrator password and
			then enter this password when you connect to your instance. It takes a few minutes after instance launch before this password is available.
			Your account must have permission to call the
GetPasswordData
action. 
			For more information, see
Example policies to control access the Amazon EC2 API
.
The default username for the Administrator account depends on the language of the operating system (OS) contained in the AMI. 
            To determine the correct username, identify the language of the OS, and then choose the corresponding username. For example,
            for an English OS, the username is
Administrator
, for a French OS it's
Administrateur
, and for a Portuguese OS it's
Administrador
. 
            If a language version of the OS does not have a username in the same language, choose the username
Administrator (Other)
. 
            For more information, see
Localized Names for Administrator Account in Windows
in the Microsoft website.
To retrieve the initial administrator password
Open the Amazon EC2 console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
.
In the navigation pane, choose
Instances
.
Select the instance and then choose
Connect
.
On the
Connect to instance
page, choose the
RDP client
tab.
For
Username
, choose the default username for the Administrator
					account. The username you choose must match the language of the operating system
					(OS) contained in the AMI that you used to launch your instance. If there is no
					username in the same language as your OS, choose
Administrator
						(Other)
.
Choose
Get password
.
On the
Get Windows password
page, do the following:
Choose
Upload private key file
and navigate to
							the private key (
.pem
) file that you specified when you launched
							the instance. Select the file and choose
Open
to
							copy the entire contents of the file to this window.
Choose
Decrypt password
. The
Get
								Windows password
page closes, and the default
							administrator password for the instance appears under
Password
, replacing the
Get
								password
link shown previously.
Copy the password and save it in a safe place. This password is required to connect to the instance.
The following procedure uses the Remote Desktop Connection client for Windows (MSTSC). If you're using a different RDP client, 
          download the RDP file and then see the documentation for the RDP client for the steps to establish the RDP connection.
To connect to a Windows instance using an RDP client
On the
Connect to instance
page, choose
Download remote desktop file
. 
								  When the file download is finished, choose
Cancel
to return to the
Instances
page. The RDP file is downloaded to your
Downloads
folder.
Run
mstsc.exe
to open the RDP client.
Expand
Show options
, choose
Open
, and select the .rdp file from your
Downloads
folder.
By default,
Computer
is the public IPv4 DNS name of the instance and
User name
is the administrator account. To connect to the instance using IPv6 instead, replace the public IPv4 DNS name of the instance  
						  		with its IPv6 address. Review the default settings and change them as needed.
Choose
Connect
. If you receive a warning that the publisher of the remote connection is unknown, 
								choose
Connect
to continue.
Enter the password that you saved previously, and then choose
OK
.
Due to the nature of self-signed certificates, you might get a warning that the security certificate could not be authenticated. 
								    Do one of the following:
If you trust the certificate, choose
Yes
to connect to your instance.
[Windows] Before you proceed, compare the thumbprint of the certificate with the value in the system log to confirm the identity of the remote computer. 
								            Choose
View certificate
and then choose
Thumbprint
from the
Details
tab.
								            Compare this value to the value of
RDPCERTIFICATE-THUMBPRINT
in
Actions
,
Monitor and troubleshoot
,
Get system log
.
[Mac OS X] Before you proceed, compare the fingerprint of the certificate with the value in the system log to confirm the identity of the remote computer. 
								            Choose
Show Certificate
, expand
Details
, and choose
SHA1 Fingerprints
.								            
								            Compare this value to the value of
RDPCERTIFICATE-THUMBPRINT
in
Actions
,
Monitor and troubleshoot
,
Get system log
.
If the RDP connection is successful, the RDP client displays the Windows login screen and then the Windows desktop. If you receive an error message instead, 
							    see
Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer
. When you are finished with the RDP connection, you can close the RDP client.
Step 3: Clean up your instance
Warning
Terminating an instance is permanent and irreversible.
After you terminate an instance, you can no longer connect to it, and it can't be recovered. 
		All attached Amazon EBS volumes that are configured to be deleted on termination are also permanently 
		deleted and can't be recovered. All data stored on instance store volumes is permanently lost. 
		For more information, see
How instance termination
				works
.
Before you terminate an instance, ensure that you have backed up all data that you need to 
		retain after the termination to persistent storage.
After you've finished with the instance that you created for this tutorial, you should
			clean up by terminating the instance. If you want to do more with this instance before
			you clean up, see
Next steps
.
You'll stop incurring charges for that instance
or usage that counts against your
			Free Tier limits
as soon as the instance status changes to
shutting down
or
terminated
. To keep your instance for later, but not incur charges
or usage that counts against your Free Tier limits
, you can stop the instance 
			now and then start it again later. For more information, see
Stop and start Amazon EC2 instances
.
To terminate your instance
In the navigation pane, choose
Instances
. In the list of
					instances, select the instance.
Choose
Instance state
,
Terminate (delete)
						instance
.
Choose
Terminate (delete)
when prompted for confirmation.
Amazon EC2 shuts down and terminates your instance. After your instance is
					terminated, it remains visible on the console for a short while, and then the
					entry is automatically deleted. You cannot remove the terminated instance from
					the console display yourself.
