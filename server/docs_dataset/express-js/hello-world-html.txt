Hello world example
Embedded below is essentially the simplest Express app you can create. It is a single file app —
not
what you’d get if you use the
Express generator
, which creates the scaffolding for a full app with numerous JavaScript files, Jade templates, and sub-directories for various purposes.
const
express
=
require
(
'
express
'
)
const
app
=
express
()
const
port
=
3000
app
.
get
(
'
/
'
,
(
req
,
res
)
=>
{
res
.
send
(
'
Hello World!
'
)
})
app
.
listen
(
port
,
()
=>
{
console
.
log
(
`Example app listening on port
${
port
}
`
)
})
This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “Hello World!” for requests
to the root URL (
/
) or
route
. For every other path, it will respond with a
404 Not Found
.
Running Locally
First create a directory named
myapp
, change to it and run
npm init
. Then, install
express
as a dependency, as per the
installation guide
.
In the
myapp
directory, create a file named
app.js
and copy the code from the example above.
The
req
(request) and
res
(response) are the exact same objects that Node provides, so you can invoke
req.pipe()
,
req.on('data', callback)
, and anything else you would do without Express involved.
Run the app with the following command:
$
node app.js
Then, load
http://localhost:3000/
in a browser to see the output.
