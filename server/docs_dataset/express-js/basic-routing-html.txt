Basic routing
Routing
refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).
Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.
Route definition takes the following structure:
app
.
METHOD
(
PATH
,
HANDLER
)
Where:
app
is an instance of
express
.
METHOD
is an
HTTP request method
, in lowercase.
PATH
is a path on the server.
HANDLER
is the function executed when the route is matched.
This tutorial assumes that an instance of
express
named
app
is created and the server is running. If you are not familiar with creating an app and starting it, see the
Hello world example
.
The following examples illustrate defining simple routes.
Respond with
Hello World!
on the homepage:
app
.
get
(
'
/
'
,
(
req
,
res
)
=>
{
res
.
send
(
'
Hello World!
'
)
})
Respond to a POST request on the root route (
/
), the application’s home page:
app
.
post
(
'
/
'
,
(
req
,
res
)
=>
{
res
.
send
(
'
Got a POST request
'
)
})
Respond to a PUT request to the
/user
route:
app
.
put
(
'
/user
'
,
(
req
,
res
)
=>
{
res
.
send
(
'
Got a PUT request at /user
'
)
})
Respond to a DELETE request to the
/user
route:
app
.
delete
(
'
/user
'
,
(
req
,
res
)
=>
{
res
.
send
(
'
Got a DELETE request at /user
'
)
})
