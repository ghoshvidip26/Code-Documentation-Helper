Cookie Parameters
¶
You can define Cookie parameters the same way you define
Query
and
Path
parameters.
Import
Cookie
¶
First import
Cookie
:
Python 3.10+
from
typing
import
Annotated
from
fastapi
import
Cookie
,
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/"
)
async
def
read_items
(
ads_id
:
Annotated
[
str
|
None
,
Cookie
()]
=
None
):
return
{
"ads_id"
:
ads_id
}
🤓 Other versions and variants
Python 3.9+
Python 3.10+ - non-Annotated

from
typing

,
Union
from

FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI

@app
.
get
(
"/items/"
)
async
def
read_items
(
ads_id
:
Annotated
[
Union
[
str
,
None
],
Cookie
()]
=
None
):
return
{
"ads_id"
:
ads_id
}
Tip
Prefer to use the
Annotated
version if possible.
from
fastapi
import
Cookie
,
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI

@app
.
get
(
"/items/"
)
async
def
read_items
(
ads_id
:
str
|
None
=
Cookie
(
default
=
None
)):
return
{
"ads_id"
:
ads_id
}
Tip

Annotated

from

@app

get
(

async
def
read_items
(
ads_id
:
Union
[
str
,
None
]
=
Cookie
(
default
=
None
)):
return
{
"ads_id"
:
ads_id
}
Declare
Cookie
parameters
¶
Then declare the cookie parameters using the same structure as with
Path
and
Query
.
You can define the default value as well as all the extra validation or annotation parameters:
Python 3.10+
from
typing
import
Annotated
from
fastapi
import
Cookie
,
FastAPI
app
=
FastAPI
()
@app
.
get
(
"/items/"
)
async
def
read_items
(
ads_id
:
Annotated
[
str
|
None
,
Cookie
()]
=
None
):
return
{
"ads_id"
:
ads_id
}

Technical Details
Cookie
is a "sister" class of
Path
and
Query
. It also inherits from the same common
Param
class.
But remember that when you import
Query
,
Path
,
Cookie
and others from
fastapi
, those are actually functions that return special classes.
Info
To declare cookies, you need to use
Cookie
, because otherwise the parameters would be interpreted as query parameters.
Info
Have in mind that, as
browsers handle cookies
in special ways and behind the scenes, they
don't
easily allow
JavaScript
to touch them.
If you go to the
API docs UI
at
/docs
you will be able to see the
documentation
for cookies for your
path operations
.
But even if you
fill the data
and click "Execute", because the docs UI works with
JavaScript
, the cookies won't be sent, and you will see an
error
message as if you didn't write any values.
Recap
¶
Declare cookies with
Cookie
, using the same common pattern as
Query
and
Path
.
