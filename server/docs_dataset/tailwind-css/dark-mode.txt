Core concepts
Dark mode
Using variants to style your site in dark mode.
Overview
Now that dark mode is a first-class feature of many operating systems, it's becoming more and more common to design a dark version of your website to go along with the default design.
To make this as easy as possible, Tailwind includes a
dark
variant that lets you style your site differently when dark mode is enabled:
Light mode
Writes upside-down
The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation,
        including upside-down. It even works in outer space.
Dark mode

The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation,
        including upside-down. It even works in outer space.
<
div
class
=
"bg-white
dark:bg-gray-800
rounded-lg px-6 py-8 ring shadow-xl ring-gray-900/5"
>
<
div
>
<
span
class
=
"inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-indigo-500 p-2 shadow-lg"
>
<
svg
class
=
"h-6 w-6 stroke-white"
...
>
<!-- ... -->
</
svg
>
</
span
>
</
div
>
<
h3
class
=
"text-gray-900
dark:text-white
mt-5 text-base font-medium tracking-tight "
>

</
h3

<
p
class
=
"text-gray-500
dark:text-gray-400
mt-2 text-sm "
>
The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space.
</
p
>
</
div
>
By default this uses the
prefers-color-scheme
CSS media feature, but you can also build sites that support
toggling dark mode manually
by overriding the dark variant.
Toggling dark mode manually
If you want your dark theme to be driven by a CSS selector instead of the
prefers-color-scheme
media query, override the
dark
variant to use your custom selector:
app.css
@import
"tailwindcss"
;
@custom-variant
dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))
;
Now instead of
dark:*
utilities being applied based on
prefers-color-scheme
, they will be applied whenever the
dark
class is present earlier in the HTML tree:
HTML
<
html
class
=
"
dark
"
>
<
body
>
<
div
class
=
"bg-white
dark
:bg-black
"
>
<!-- ... -->
</
div
>
</
body
>
</
html
>
How you add the
dark
class to the
html
element is up to you, but a common approach is to use a bit of JavaScript that updates the
class
attribute and syncs that preference to somewhere like
localStorage
.
Using a data attribute
To use a data attribute instead of a class to activate dark mode, just override the
dark
variant with an attribute selector instead:
app.css
@import
"tailwindcss"
;
@custom-variant
dark (&:where([data-theme=dark], [data-theme=dark] *))
;
Now dark mode utilities will be applied whenever the
data-theme
attribute is set to
dark
somewhere up the tree:
HTML
<
html
data-theme
=
"dark"
>
<
body
>
<
div
class
=
"bg-white
dark:bg-black
"
>
<!-- ... -->
</
div
>
</
body
>
</
html
>
With system theme support
To build three-way theme toggles that support light mode, dark mode, and your system theme, use a custom dark mode selector and the
window.matchMedia()
API
to detect the system theme and update the
html
element when needed.
Here's a simple example of how you can support light mode, dark mode, as well as respecting the operating system preference:
spaghetti.js
// On page load or when changing themes, best to add inline in `head` to avoid FOUC
document
.
documentElement
.
classList
.
toggle
(
"dark"
,
localStorage
.
theme
===
"dark"
||
(
!
(
"theme"
in
localStorage
)
&&
window
.
matchMedia
(
"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
)
.
matches
)
,
)
;
// Whenever the user explicitly chooses light mode
localStorage
.
theme
=
"light"
;
// Whenever the user explicitly chooses dark mode
localStorage
.
theme
=
"dark"
;
// Whenever the user explicitly chooses to respect the OS preference
localStorage
.
removeItem
(
"theme"
)
;
Again you can manage this however you like, even storing the preference server-side in a database and rendering the class on the server — it's totally up to you.
