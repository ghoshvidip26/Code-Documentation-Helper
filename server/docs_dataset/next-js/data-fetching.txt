Fetching Data
Last updated
December 3, 2025
This page will walk you through how you can fetch data in
Server and Client Components
, and how to
stream
components that depend on data.
Fetching data
Server Components
You can fetch data in Server Components using any asynchronous I/O, such as:
The
fetch
API
An
ORM or database
Reading from the filesystem using Node.js APIs like
fs
With the
fetch
API
To fetch data with the
fetch
API, turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the
fetch
call. For example:
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
export
default
async
function
Page
() {
const
data
=
await
fetch
(
'https://api.vercel.app/
blog
'
)
const
posts
=
await
data
.json
()
return
(
<
ul
>
{
posts
.map
((post)
=>
(
<
li
key
=
{
post
.id}>{
post
.title}</
li
>
))}
</
ul
>
)
}
Good to know:
fetch
responses are not cached by default. However, Next.js will
pre-render
the route and the output will be cached for improved performance. If you'd like to opt into
dynamic rendering
, use the
{ cache: 'no-store' }
option. See the
fetch
API Reference
.
During development, you can log
fetch
calls for better visibility and debugging. See the
logging
API reference
.
With an ORM or database
Since Server Components are rendered on the server, you can safely make database queries using an ORM or database client. Turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the call:
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
{ db
,
posts }
from
'@/lib/db'
export
default
async
function
Page
() {
const
allPosts
=
await
db
.select
()
.from
(posts)
return
(
<
ul
>
{
allPosts
.map
((post)
=>
(
<
li
key
=
{
post
.id}>{
post
.title}</
li
>
))}
</
ul
>
)
}
Client Components
There are two ways to fetch data in Client Components, using:
React's
use
hook
A community library like
SWR
or
React Query
Streaming data with the
use
hook
You can use React's
use
hook
to
stream
data from the server to client. Start by fetching data in your Server component, and pass the promise to your Client Component as prop:
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
Posts
from
'@/app/ui/posts'
import
{ Suspense }
from
'react'
export
default
function
Page
() {
// Don't await the data fetching function
const
posts
=
getPosts
()
return
(
<
Suspense
fallback
=
{<
div
>Loading...</
div
>}>
<
Posts
posts
=
{posts} />
</
Suspense
>
)
}
Then, in your Client Component, use the
use
hook to read the promise:
app/ui/posts.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
'use client'
import
{ use }
from
'react'
export
default
function
Posts
({
posts
,
}
:
{
posts
:
Promise
<{ id
:
string
; title
:
string
}[]>
}) {
const
allPosts
=
use
(posts)
return
(
<
ul
>
{
allPosts
.map
((post)
=>
(
<
li
key
=
{
post
.id}>{
post
.title}</
li
>
))}
</
ul
>
)
}
In the example above, the
<Posts>
component is wrapped in a
<Suspense>
boundary
. This means the fallback will be shown while the promise is being resolved. Learn more about
streaming
.
Community libraries
You can use a community library like
SWR
or
React Query
to fetch data in Client Components. These libraries have their own semantics for caching, streaming, and other features. For example, with SWR:
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
'use client'
import
useSWR
from
'swr'
const
fetcher
=
(url)
=>
fetch
(url)
.then
((r)
=>
r
.json
())
export
default
function
BlogPage
() {
const
{
data
,
error
,
isLoading
}
=
useSWR
(
'https://api.vercel.app/
blog
'
,
fetcher
)
if
(isLoading)
return
<
div
>Loading...</
div
>
if
(error)
return
<
div
>Error: {
error
.message}</
div
>
return
(
<
ul
>
{
data
.map
((post
:
{ id
:
string
; title
:
string
})
=>
(
<
li
key
=
{
post
.id}>{
post
.title}</
li
>
))}
</
ul
>
)
}
Deduplicate requests and cache data
One way to deduplicate
fetch
requests is with
request memoization
. With this mechanism,
fetch
calls using
GET
or
HEAD
with the same URL and options in a single render pass are combined into one request. This happens automatically, and you can
opt out
by passing an Abort signal to
fetch
.
Request memoization is scoped to the lifetime of a request.
You can also deduplicate
fetch
requests by using Next.js’
Data Cache
, for example by setting
cache: 'force-cache'
in your
fetch
options.
Data Cache allows sharing data across the current render pass and incoming requests.
If you are
not
using
fetch
, and instead using an ORM or database directly, you can wrap your data access with the
React
cache
function.
app/lib/data.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
{ cache }
from
'react'
import
{ db
,
posts
,
eq }
from
'@/
lib
/db'
export
const
getPost
=
cache
(
async
(id
:
string
)
=>
{
const
post
=
await
db
.
query
.
posts
.findFirst
({
where
:
eq
(
posts
.id
,
parseInt
(id))
,
})
})
Streaming
Warning:
The content below assumes the
cacheComponents
config option
is enabled in your application. The flag was introduced in Next.js 15 canary.
When you fetch data in Server Components, the data is fetched and rendered on the server for each request. If you have any slow data requests, the whole route will be blocked from rendering until all the data is fetched.
To improve the initial load time and user experience, you can use streaming to break up the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.
There are two ways you can leverage streaming in your application:
Wrapping a page with a
loading.js
file
Wrapping a component with
<Suspense>
With
loading.js
You can create a
loading.js
file in the same folder as your page to stream the
entire page
while the data is being fetched. For example, to stream
app/blog/page.js
, add the file inside the
app/blog
folder.
app/blog/loading.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
export
default
function
Loading
() {
// Define the Loading UI here
return
<
div
>Loading...</
div
>
}
On navigation, the user will immediately see the layout and a
loading state
while the page is being rendered. The new content will then be automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.
Behind-the-scenes,
loading.js
will be nested inside
layout.js
, and will automatically wrap the
page.js
file and any children below in a
<Suspense>
boundary.
This approach works well for route segments (layouts and pages), but for more granular streaming, you can use
<Suspense>
.
With
<Suspense>
<Suspense>
allows you to be more granular about what parts of the page to stream. For example, you can immediately show any page content that falls outside of the
<Suspense>
boundary, and stream in the list of blog posts inside the boundary.
app/blog/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
{ Suspense }
from
'react'
import
BlogList
from
'@/components/BlogList'
import
BlogListSkeleton
from
'@/components/BlogListSkeleton'
export
default
function
BlogPage
() {
return
(
<
div
>
{
/* This content will be sent to the client immediately */
}
<
header
>
<
h1
>Welcome to the Blog</
h1
>
<
p
>Read the latest posts below.</
p
>
</
header
>
<
main
>
{
/* If there's any dynamic content inside this boundary, it will be streamed in */
}
<
Suspense
fallback
=
{<
BlogListSkeleton
/>}>
<
BlogList
/>
</
Suspense
>
</
main
>
</
div
>
)
}
Creating meaningful loading states
An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately to the user after navigation. For the best user experience, we recommend designing loading states that are meaningful and help users understand the app is responding. For example, you can use skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc.
In development, you can preview and inspect the loading state of your components using the
React Devtools
.
Examples
Sequential data fetching
Sequential data fetching happens when one request depends on data from another.
For example,
<Playlists>
can only fetch data after
<Artist>
completes because it needs the
artistID
:
app/artist/[username]/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
export
default
async
function
Page
({
params
,
}
:
{
params
:
Promise
<{ username
:
string
}>
}) {
const
{
username
}
=
await
params
// Get
artist
information
const
artist
=
await
getArtist
(username)
return
(
<>
<
h1
>{
artist
.name}</
h1
>
{
/* Show fallback UI while the Playlists component is loading */
}
<
Suspense
fallback
=
{<
div
>Loading...</
div
>}>
{
/* Pass the
artist
ID to the Playlists component */
}
<
Playlists
artist
ID
=
{
artist
.id} />
</
Suspense
>
</>
)
}
async
function
Playlists
({
artist
ID }
:
{
artist
ID
:
string
}) {
// Use the
artist
ID to fetch playlists
const
playlists
=
await
getArtistPlaylists
(
artist
ID)
return
(
<
ul
>
{
playlists
.map
((playlist)
=>
(
<
li
key
=
{
playlist
.id}>{
playlist
.name}</
li
>
))}
</
ul
>
)
}
In this example,
<Suspense>
allows the playlists to stream in after the artist data loads. However, the page still waits for the artist data before displaying anything. To prevent this, you can wrap the entire page component in a
<Suspense>
boundary (for example, using a
loading.js
file
) to show a loading state immediately.
Ensure your data source can resolve the first request quickly, as it blocks everything else. If you can't optimize the request further, consider
caching
the result if the data changes infrequently.
Parallel data fetching
Parallel data fetching happens when data requests in a route are eagerly initiated and start at the same time.
By default,
layouts and pages
are rendered in parallel. So each segment starts fetching data as soon as possible.
However, within
any
component, multiple
async
/
await
requests can still be sequential if placed after the other. For example,
getAlbums
will be blocked until
getArtist
is resolved:
app/artist/[username]/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
{ getArtist
,
getAlbums }
from
'@/app/lib/data'
export
default
async
function
Page
({ params }) {
// These requests will be sequential
const
{
username
}
=
await
params
const
artist
=
await
getArtist
(username)
const
albums
=
await
getAlbums
(username)
return
<
div
>{
artist
.name}</
div
>
}
Start multiple requests by calling
fetch
, then await them with
Promise.all
. Requests begin as soon as
fetch
is called.
app/artist/[username]/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
Albums
from
'./albums'
async
function
getArtist
(username
:
string
) {
const
res
=
await
fetch
(
`https://api.example.com/
artist
/
${
username
}
`
)
return
res
.json
()
}
async
function
getAlbums
(username
:
string
) {
const
res
=
await
fetch
(
`https://api.example.com/
artist
/
${
username
}
/albums`
)
return
res
.json
()
}
export
default
async
function
Page
({
params
,
}
:
{
params
:
Promise
<{ username
:
string
}>
}) {
const
{
username
}
=
await
params
// Initiate requests
const
artist
Data
=
getArtist
(username)
const
albumsData
=
getAlbums
(username)
const
[
artist
,
albums
]
=
await
Promise
.all
([
artist
Data
,
albumsData])
return
(
<>
<
h1
>{
artist
.name}</
h1
>
<
Albums
list
=
{albums} />
</>
)
}
Good to know:
If one request fails when using
Promise.all
, the entire operation will fail. To handle this, you can use the
Promise.allSettled
method instead.
Preloading data
You can preload data by creating a utility function that you eagerly call above blocking requests.
<Item>
conditionally renders based on the
checkIsAvailable()
function.
You can call
preload()
before
checkIsAvailable()
to eagerly initiate
<Item/>
data dependencies. By the time
<Item/>
is rendered, its data has already been fetched.
app/item/[id]/page.tsx
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
{ getItem
,
checkIsAvailable }
from
'@/lib/data'
export
default
async
function
Page
({
params
,
}
:
{
params
:
Promise
<{ id
:
string
}>
}) {
const
{
id
}
=
await
params
// starting loading
item
data
preload
(id)
// perform another asynchronous task
const
isAvailable
=
await
checkIsAvailable
()
return
isAvailable
?
<
Item
id
=
{id} />
:
null
}
const
preload
=
(id
:
string
)
=>
{
// void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined
// https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void
void
getItem
(id)
}
export
async
function
Item
({ id }
:
{ id
:
string
}) {
const
result
=
await
getItem
(id)
// ...
}
Additionally, you can use React's
cache
function
and the
server-only
package
to create a reusable utility function. This approach allows you to cache the data fetching function and ensure that it's only executed on the server.
utils/get-item.ts
TypeScript
JavaScript
TypeScript
import
{ cache }
from
'react'
import
'server-only'
import
{ getItem }
from
'@/lib/data'
export
const
preload
=
(id
:
string
)
=>
{
void
getItem
(id)
}
export
const
getItem
=
cache
(
async
(id
:
string
)
=>
{
// ...
})
