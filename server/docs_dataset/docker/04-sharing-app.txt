Summary
Next steps
Now that you've built an image, you can share it. To share Docker images, you have to use a Docker
registry. The default registry is Docker Hub and is where all of the images you've used have come from.
Docker ID
A Docker ID lets you access Docker Hub, which is the world's largest library and community for container images. Create a
Docker ID
for free if you don't have one.
Create a repository
To push an image, you first need to create a repository on Docker Hub.
Sign up
or Sign in to
Docker Hub
.
Select the
Create Repository
button.
For the repository name, use
getting-started
. Make sure the
Visibility
is
Public
.
Select
Create
.
In the following image, you can see an example Docker command from Docker Hub. This command will push to this repository.
Push the image
Let's try to push the image to Docker Hub.
In the command line, run the following command:
docker push docker/getting-started
You'll see an error like this:
$
docker push docker/getting-started
The push refers to repository [docker.io/docker/getting-started]
An image does not exist locally with the tag: docker/getting-started
This failure is expected because the image isn't tagged correctly yet.
Docker is looking for an image name
docker/getting started
, but your
local image is still named
getting-started
.
You can confirm this by running:
docker image ls
To fix this, first sign in to Docker Hub using your Docker ID:
docker login YOUR-USER-NAME
.
Use the
docker tag
command to give the
getting-started
image a new name. Replace
YOUR-USER-NAME
with your Docker ID.
$
docker tag getting-started YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
Now run the
docker push
command again. If you're copying the value from
Docker Hub, you can drop the
tagname
part, as you didn't add a tag to the
image name. If you don't specify a tag, Docker uses a tag called
latest
.
$
docker push YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
Run the image on a new instance
Now that your image has been built and pushed into a registry, try running your app on a brand
new instance that has never seen this container image. To do this, you will use Play with Docker.
Note
Play with Docker uses the amd64 platform. If you are using an ARM based Mac with Apple silicon, you will need to rebuild the image to be compatible with Play with Docker and push the new image to your repository.
To build an image for the amd64 platform, use the
--platform
flag.
$
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started .
Docker buildx also supports building multi-platform images. To learn more, see
Multi-platform images
.
Open your browser to
Play with Docker
.
Select
Login
and then select
docker
from the drop-down list.
Sign in with your Docker Hub account and then select
Start
.
Select the
ADD NEW INSTANCE
option on the left side bar. If you don't see it, make your browser a little wider. After a few seconds, a terminal window opens in your browser.
In the terminal, start your freshly pushed app.
$
docker run -dp 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
You should see the image get pulled down and eventually start up.
Tip
You may have noticed that this command binds the port mapping to a
different IP address. Previous
docker run
commands published ports to
127.0.0.1:3000
on the host. This time, you're using
0.0.0.0
.
Binding to
127.0.0.1
only exposes a container's ports to the loopback
interface. Binding to
0.0.0.0
, however, exposes the container's port
on all interfaces of the host, making it available to the outside world.
For more information about how port mapping works, see
Networking
.
Select the 3000 badge when it appears.
If the 3000 badge doesn't appear, you can select
Open Port
and specify
3000
.
Summary
In this section, you learned how to share your images by pushing them to a
registry. You then went to a brand new instance and were able to run the freshly
pushed image. This is quite common in CI pipelines, where the pipeline will
create the image and push it to a registry and then the production environment
can use the latest version of the image.
