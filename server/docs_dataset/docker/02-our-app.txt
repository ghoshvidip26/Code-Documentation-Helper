Summary
Next steps
For the rest of this guide, you'll be working with a simple todo
list manager that runs on Node.js. If you're not familiar with Node.js,
don't worry. This guide doesn't require any prior experience with JavaScript.
Prerequisites
You have installed the latest version of
Docker Desktop
.
You have installed a
Git client
.
You have an IDE or a text editor to edit files. Docker recommends using
Visual Studio Code
.
Get the app
Before you can run the application, you need to get the application source code onto your machine.
Clone the
getting-started-app repository
using the following command:
$
git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-app.git
View the contents of the cloned repository. You should see the following files and sub-directories.
âââ getting-started-app/
â âââ .dockerignore
â âââ package.json
â âââ README.md
â âââ spec/
â âââ src/
â âââ yarn.lock
Build the app's image
To build the image, you'll need to use a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is simply a text-based file with no file extension that contains a script of instructions. Docker uses this script to build a container image.
In the
getting-started-app
directory, the same location as the
package.json
file, create a file named
Dockerfile
with the following contents:
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM
node:lts-alpine
WORKDIR
/app
COPY
. .
RUN
yarn install --production
CMD
[
"node"
,
"src/index.js"
]
EXPOSE
3000
This Dockerfile starts off with a
node:lts-alpine
base image, a
light-weight Linux image that comes with Node.js and the Yarn package
manager pre-installed. It copies all of the source code into the image,
installs the necessary dependencies, and starts the application.
Build the image using the following commands:
In the terminal, make sure you're in the
getting-started-app
directory. Replace
/path/to/getting-started-app
with the path to your
getting-started-app
directory.
$
cd
/path/to/getting-started-app
Build the image.
$
docker build -t getting-started .
The
docker build
command uses the Dockerfile to build a new image. You might have noticed that Docker downloaded a lot of "layers". This is because you instructed the builder that you wanted to start from the
node:lts-alpine
image. But, since you didn't have that on your machine, Docker needed to download the image.
After Docker downloaded the image, the instructions from the Dockerfile copied in your application and used
yarn
to install your application's dependencies. The
CMD
directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container from this image.
Finally, the
-t
flag tags your image. Think of this as a human-readable name for the final image. Since you named the image
getting-started
, you can refer to that image when you run a container.
The
.
at the end of the
docker build
command tells Docker that it should look for the
Dockerfile
in the current directory.
Start an app container
Now that you have an image, you can run the application in a container using the
docker run
command.
Run your container using the
docker run
command and specify the name of the image you just created:
$
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started
The
-d
flag (short for
--detach
) runs the container in the background.
This means that Docker starts your container and returns you to the terminal
prompt. Also, it does not display logs in the terminal.
The
-p
flag (short for
--publish
) creates a port mapping between the
host and the container. The
-p
flag takes a string value in the format of
HOST:CONTAINER
, where
HOST
is the address on the host, and
CONTAINER
is the port on the container. The command publishes the container's port
3000 to
127.0.0.1:3000
(
localhost:3000
) on the host. Without the port
mapping, you wouldn't be able to access the application from the host.
After a few seconds, open your web browser to
http://localhost:3000
.
You should see your app.
Add an item or two and see that it works as you expect. You can mark items as complete and remove them. Your frontend is successfully storing items in the backend.
At this point, you have a running todo list manager with a few items.
If you take a quick look at your containers, you should see at least one container running that's using the
getting-started
image and on port
3000
. To see your containers, you can use the CLI or Docker Desktop's graphical interface.
CLI
Docker Desktop
Run the
docker ps
command in a terminal to list your containers.
$
docker ps
Output similar to the following should appear.
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
df784548666d        getting-started     "docker-entrypoint.sâ¦"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        127.0.0.1:3000->3000/tcp   priceless_mcclintock
In Docker Desktop, select the
Containers
tab to see a list of your containers.
Summary
In this section, you learned the basics about creating a Dockerfile to build an image. Once you built an image, you started a container and saw the running app.

Next, you're going to make a modification to your app and learn how to update your running application with a new image. Along the way, you'll learn a few other useful commands.
