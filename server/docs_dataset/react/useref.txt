useRef

API Reference
Hooks
useRef
useRef
is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering.
const
ref
=
useRef
(
initialValue
)
Reference
useRef(initialValue)
Usage
Referencing a value with a ref
Manipulating the DOM with a ref
Avoiding recreating the ref contents
Troubleshooting
I can’t get a ref to a custom component
Reference
useRef(initialValue)
Call
useRef
at the top level of your component to declare a
ref.
import
{
useRef
}
from
'react'
;
function
MyComponent
(
)
{
const
intervalRef
=
useRef
(
0
)
;
const
inputRef
=
useRef
(
null
)
;
// ...
See more examples below.
Parameters
initialValue
: The value you want the ref object’s
current
property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.
Returns
useRef
returns an object with a single property:
current
: Initially, it’s set to the
initialValue
you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a
ref
attribute to a JSX node, React will set its
current
property.
On the next renders,
useRef
will return the same object.
Caveats
You can mutate the
ref.current
property. Unlike state, it is mutable. However, if it holds an object that is used for rendering (for example, a piece of your state), then you shouldn’t mutate that object.
When you change the
ref.current
property, React does not re-render your component. React is not aware of when you change it because a ref is a plain JavaScript object.
Do not write
or read
ref.current
during rendering, except for
initialization.
This makes your component’s behavior unpredictable.
In Strict Mode, React will
call your component function twice
in order to
help you find accidental impurities.
This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. Each ref object will be created twice, but one of the versions will be discarded. If your component function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior.
Usage
Referencing a value with a ref
Call
useRef
at the top level of your component to declare one or more
refs.
import
{
useRef
}
from
'react'
;
function
Stopwatch
(
)
{
const
intervalRef
=
useRef
(
0
)
;
// ...
useRef
returns a
ref object
with a single
current
property
initially set to the
initial value
you provided.
On the next renders,
useRef
will return the same object. You can change its
current
property to store information and read it later. This might remind you of
state
, but there is an important difference.
Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render.
This means refs are perfect for storing information that doesn’t affect the visual output of your component. For example, if you need to store an
interval ID
and retrieve it later, you can put it in a ref. To update the value inside the ref, you need to manually change its
current
property
:
function
handleStartClick
(
)
{
const
intervalId
=
setInterval
(
(
)
=>
{
// ...
}
,
1000
)
;
intervalRef.current
=
intervalId
;
}
Later, you can read that interval ID from the ref so that you can call
clear that interval
:
function
handleStopClick
(
)
{
const
intervalId
=
intervalRef.current
;
clearInterval
(
intervalId
)
;
}
By using a ref, you ensure that:
You can
store information
between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).
Changing it
does not trigger a re-render
(unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
The
information is local
to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).
Changing a ref does not trigger a re-render, so refs are not appropriate for storing information you want to display on the screen. Use state for that instead. Read more about
choosing between
useRef
and
useState
.

Example
1
of

:
Click counter
This component uses a ref to keep track of how many times the button was clicked. Note that it’s okay to use a ref instead of state here because the click count is only read and written in an event handler.

}
Show more
If you show
{ref.current}
in the JSX, the number won’t update on click. This is because setting
ref.current
does not trigger a re-render. Information that’s used for rendering should be state instead.

Example
Pitfall
Do not write
or read
ref.current
during rendering.
React expects that the body of your component
behaves like a pure function
:
If the inputs (
props
,
state
, and
context
) are the same, it should return exactly the same JSX.
Calling it in a different order or with different arguments should not affect the results of other calls.
Reading or writing a ref
during rendering
breaks these expectations.
function
MyComponent
(
)
{
// ...
// 🚩 Don't write a ref during rendering
myRef
.
current
=
123
;
// ...
// 🚩 Don't read a ref during rendering
return
<
h1
>
{
myOtherRef
.
current
}
</
h1
>
;
}
You can read or write refs
from event handlers or effects instead
.
function
MyComponent
(
)
{
// ...
useEffect
(
(
)
=>
{
// ✅ You can read or write refs in effects
myRef
.
current
=
123
;
}
)
;
// ...
function
handleClick
(
)
{
// ✅ You can read or write refs in event handlers
doSomething
(
myOtherRef
.
current
)
;
}
// ...
}
If you
have to
read
or write
something during rendering,
use state
instead.
When you break these rules, your component might still work, but most of the newer features we’re adding to React will rely on these expectations. Read more about
keeping your components pure.
Manipulating the DOM with a ref
It’s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the
DOM.
React has built-in support for this.
First, declare a
ref object
with an
initial value
of
null
:
import
{
useRef
}
from
'react'
;
function
MyComponent
(
)
{
const
inputRef
=
useRef
(
null
)
;
// ...
Then pass your ref object as the
ref
attribute to the JSX of the DOM node you want to manipulate:
// ...
return
<
input
ref
=
{
inputRef
}
/>
;
After React creates the DOM node and puts it on the screen, React will set the
current
property
of your ref object to that DOM node. Now you can access the
<input>
’s DOM node and call methods like
focus()
:
function
handleClick
(
)
{
inputRef.current
.
focus
(
)
;
}
React will set the
current
property back to
null
when the node is removed from the screen.

import

'react'

export
default
function

{
const
inputRef
=
useRef
(
null
)
;
function
handleClick
(
)
{
inputRef
.
current
.
focus
(
)
;
}
return
(
<
>
<
input
ref
=
{
inputRef
}
/>
<
button
onClick
=
{
handleClick
}
>
Focus the input
</
button
>
</
>
)
;
}

Example
Avoiding recreating the ref contents
React saves the initial ref value once and ignores it on the next renders.
function
Video
(
)
{
const
playerRef
=
useRef
(
new
VideoPlayer
(
)
)
;
// ...
Although the result of
new VideoPlayer()
is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating expensive objects.
To solve it, you may initialize the ref like this instead:
function
Video
(
)
{
const
playerRef
=
useRef
(
null
)
;
if
(
playerRef
.
current
===
null
)
{
playerRef
.
current
=
new
VideoPlayer
(
)
;
}
// ...
Normally, writing or reading
ref.current
during render is not allowed. However, it’s fine in this case because the result is always the same, and the condition only executes during initialization so it’s fully predictable.
Deep Dive
How to avoid null checks when initializing useRef later
Show Details
If you use a type checker and don’t want to always check for
null
, you can try a pattern like this instead:
function
Video
(
)
{
const
playerRef
=
useRef
(
null
)
;
function
getPlayer
(
)
{
if
(
playerRef
.
current
!==
null
)
{
return
playerRef
.
current
;
}
const
player
=
new
VideoPlayer
(
)
;
playerRef
.
current
=
player
;
return
player
;
}
// ...
Here, the
playerRef
itself is nullable. However, you should be able to convince your type checker that there is no case in which
getPlayer()
returns
null
. Then use
getPlayer()
in your event handlers.
Troubleshooting
I can’t get a ref to a custom component
If you try to pass a
ref
to your own component like this:
const
inputRef
=
useRef
(
null
)
;
return
<
MyInput
ref
=
{
inputRef
}
/>
;
You might get an error in the console:
Console
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null
By default, your own components don’t expose refs to the DOM nodes inside them.
To fix this, find the component that you want to get a ref to:
export
default
function
MyInput
(
{
value
,
onChange
}
)
{
return
(
<
input
value
=
{
value
}
onChange
=
{
onChange
}
/>
)
;
}
And then add
ref
to the list of props your component accepts and pass
ref
as a prop to the relevant child
built-in component
like this:
function
MyInput
(
{
value
,
onChange
,
ref
}
)
{
return
(
<
input
value
=
{
value
}
onChange
=
{
onChange
}
ref
=
{
ref
}
/>
)
;
}
;
export
default
MyInput
;
Then the parent component can get a ref to it.
